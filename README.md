# Market Basket Analysis for Retailers

## Task Overview
In this task, you will implement a Market Basket Analysis using association rule mining, specifically using the Apriori algorithm. The goal is to extract meaningful patterns from retail transaction data and use these insights to make actionable business decisions. You will work with a dataset of retail transactions and apply MBA to identify products frequently bought together.

## Problem Statement & Use Cases
Retailers are constantly looking for ways to improve their product placement and increase sales. Market Basket Analysis helps retailers to discover associations between products frequently bought together. These insights can be used for better product bundling, improved store layout, and creating cross-selling opportunities. By identifying hidden patterns in transaction data, businesses can gain a competitive edge.

Consider a supermarket that wants to optimize its product placement strategy. By using Market Basket Analysis, the store can identify pairs or groups of products that customers often purchase together, such as bread and butter, or chips and soda. With this knowledge, the store can reorganize the product layout or create bundle offers to increase convenience and boost sales.
